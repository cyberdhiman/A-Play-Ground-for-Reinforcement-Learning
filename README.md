# Reinforcement-Learining--Q-Learning-Algorithm-
Under reinforcement learning model, I  implemented Q Learning algorithm which is a basic form of reinforcement learning to solve a problem in which an agent will be placed in any room of a building and the goal is to reach outside the building.


Steps:
 1: First run reinforcement.py :
   
     >>python3 reinforcement.py
   It will generate a model_history.json
 2: Then go to here https://repl.it/@cyberdhiman/Reinfrocement-Learning  and upload that json file and then play.
